  "body": "# ExoPlayer #\r\n\r\nExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android. It provides an\r\nalternative to Android’s MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both\r\nlocally and over the Internet. ExoPlayer supports features not currently\r\nsupported by Android’s MediaPlayer API, including DASH and SmoothStreaming\r\nadaptive playbacks. Unlike the MediaPlayer API, ExoPlayer is easy to customize\r\nand extend, and can be updated through Play Store application updates.\r\n\r\n## Documentation ##\r\n\r\n* The [developer guide][] provides a wealth of information to help you get\r\n  started.\r\n* The [class reference][] documents the ExoPlayer library classes.\r\n* The [release notes][] document the major changes in each release.\r\n\r\n[developer guide]: https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/guide.html\r\n[class reference]: https://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/doc/reference\r\n[release notes]: https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/blob/dev/RELEASENOTES.md\r\n\r\n## Using ExoPlayer ##\r\n\r\n#### Via jCenter ####\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started using ExoPlayer is by including the following in\r\nyour project's `build.gradle` file:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\ncompile 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:rX.X.X'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `rX.X.X` is the your preferred version. For the latest version, see the\r\nproject's [Releases][]. For more details, see the project on [Bintray][].\r\n\r\n[Releases]: https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/releases\r\n[Bintray]: https://bintray.com/google/exoplayer/exoplayer/view\r\n\r\n#### As source ####\r\n\r\nExoPlayer can also be built from source using Gradle. You can include it as a\r\ndependent project like so:\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\n// settings.gradle\r\ninclude ':app', ':..:ExoPlayer:library'\r\n\r\n// app/build.gradle\r\ndependencies {\r\n    compile project(':..:ExoPlayer:library')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### As a jar ####\r\n\r\nIf you want to use ExoPlayer as a jar, run:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./gradlew jarRelease\r\n```\r\n\r\nand copy `library.jar` to the libs folder of your new project.\r\n\r\n## Developing ExoPlayer ##\r\n\r\n#### Project branches ####\r\n\r\n  * The project has `dev-vX` and `release-vX` branches, where `X` is the major\r\n    version number.\r\n  * Most development work happens on the `dev-vX` branch with the highest major\r\n    version number. Pull requests should normally be made to this branch.\r\n  * Bug fixes may be submitted to older `dev-vX` branches. When doing this, the\r\n    same (or an equivalent) fix should also be submitted to all subsequent\r\n    `dev-vX` branches.\r\n  * A `release-vX` branch holds the most recent stable release for major version\r\n    `X`.\r\n\r\n#### Using Android Studio ####\r\n\r\nTo develop ExoPlayer using Android Studio, simply open the ExoPlayer project in\r\nthe root directory of the repository.\r\n",
