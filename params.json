Pull requests should normally be made to this branch.\r\n  * Bug fixes may be submitted to older `dev-vX` branches. When doing this, the\r\n    same (or an equivalent) fix should also be submitted to all subsequent\r\n    `dev-vX` branches.\r\n  * A `release-vX` branch holds the most recent stable release for major version\r\n    `X`.\r\n\r\n# ExoPlayer #\r\n\r\nExoPlayer is an application level media player made by Google.\r\nPlease refer to the original README.MD of ExoPlayer for more detail.\r\n\r\n# Project branches #\r\n\r\n  * `ab-dev-vX` is the development branch of this project, where `X` is the major\r\n    version number of ExoPlayer.\r\n  * Pull requests should normally be made to this branch.\r\n\r\n",
